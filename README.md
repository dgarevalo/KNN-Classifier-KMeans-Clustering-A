## Execution
1) To test the program, run the `Makefile` file:
```bash
cd code
make
```

2) In the same folder, execute the created binary:
```bash
./program
```

## Notes
Datasets can be generated in addition to those provided by the course instructors.

* If you choose to generate a new one, you will need to specify the number of clusters `k`, the number of dimensions `d` for the points, and the number of points `n` per cluster. In total, there will be n*d points.

* Alternatively, you can select one of the provided datasets (a number between 1 and 6, inclusive).

Once the dataset is chosen, more specific questions will follow, such as whether to run the k-means or k-medoids algorithm.  
Additionally, you can choose to find the optimal `k` for a given input dataset.
